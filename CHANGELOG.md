## [6.0.7] - 2017-12-25
### Changed
- Updated the title regex.
- Optimized cURL options.

## [6.0.6] - 2017-12-24 üéÑ
### Changed
- Now using the `/reference` page instead of the `/combined` one.
- Using `sha1` instead of `md5` for filenames of the caches. This should invalidate all old ones automatically. **I'd recommend cleaning `/cache` anyway!**
- Updated almost all regular expressions. *Thanks to @paulitap for the great work!*
- Closed #87 üôå
- Fixed a typo. *Why did nobody tell me before? üòû*
- Some smaller changes I can't remember.

## [6.0.5] - 2016-06-06
### Changed
- Disabled `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` in the `runCurl` method. Please check http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php for more details on these configuration settings. This should fix the problem of downloading posters without valid certificates and stuff like that.
- Reformatted some code and stuff. *(Yeah, the code quality of this project is bad, I know.)*
- Requires PHP 5.6+ in `composer.json`.

## [6.0.4] - 2016-06-06
### Changed
- Fixed `IMDB_SEASONS`.

## [6.0.3] - 2016-01-08
### Changed
- Fixed `getPoster`. It most likely always did a hot link to IMDB instead of the local image. The default is now to hot link to IMDb with the small resolution.
- Made the private `$iId` variable public. You can now access the ID of the movie without any problems (eg. `$oIMDB->iId`).
- Reformatted `imdb.example.php` and also fixed a small issue there.

## [6.0.2] - 2015-12-19
### Changed
- Added more test cases to `imdb.example.php`.
- Fixed `getYear` (#70 & #71).
- Reformatted `imdb.class.php` (again‚Ä¶) and fixed some third-party spelling issues.
- Fixed `cleanString` (#69).

### Removed
- `getMovieMeter`.

## [6.0.1] - 2015-09-12
### Changed
- `LICENSE` year updated.
- `imdb.example.php` and `imdb.tests.php` reformatted. Also added a new test.
- Fixed `getGenre` (#66). *Thanks, doodley2!*
- Reformatted `imdb.class.php`. Also changed some code.

### Added
- `.editorconfig` added. Please make sure that your editor uses these settings. See [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org/).

## [6.0.0] - 2015-01-02
### Changed
- Since this script is still heavily used by you guys, I decided to clean up the codebase. It‚Äôs still far away from being a great example of good code ‚Äì but remember: This all started on a Saturday, when I was feeling sick and didn‚Äôt have anything else to do.
- Switched back to MIT license. People never cared that they‚Äôre not allowed to use this commercially, so I give up. **This is still a proof of concept and you should not use this in any way.**
- Removed all the 3rd party stuff.
- Moved `imdb.example.php` to the new directory *examples*. Same goes with `imdb.tests.php`, since this file doesn‚Äôt contain real ‚Äútests‚Äù.
- As it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, I removed the changelog of everything below v6.0.0.
- ‚ÄúTo use [Yoda conditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions) as much as possible trying.‚Äù
- Switched to the ‚Äúcombined‚Äù page. This enables easier scrapping, but we lose some methods (like `getBudget()` or `getDescription()`). Then again, a few new ones where added. See README.
- Removed `getFullCast()`, because `getCast()` now returns the full cast.
